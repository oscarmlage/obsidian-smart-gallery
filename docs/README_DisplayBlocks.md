## matchCase
default:false
Should tags be required to match case of the filter
## imgWidth
default: assigned in settings
Max width of the columns in pixels
## imgHeight

## divAlign
default:left

## sort
default:unsorted
name: sort in order of file name
path: sort in order of file name, but grouped by file structure
cdate: sort by date the image file was added to this vault NOTE: in obsidian, files created on another machine have a cdate based on when they reached THIS machine

## reverseOrder
default:false
